# Music_Player
Music Player website created using Django

You can go to the real-time working project: https://djmusical.onrender.com/

Of course in the production version I secured everything and used Render.com to deploy my project, for the database AWS (S3) service is working, also added Postgresql for some cases(it's disabled since AWS is working instead).
